LcdMCP
======

LcdMCP is a library that extends LiquidCrystal library to support windows and settings of specific variables related to using the display as a MCP simulator.

I use the I2C version of the LiquidCrystal library (right now i'm using a LCD2004 based display from Sainsmart, so it's the only one supported).


Installation
------------

Put the library on your arduino libraries folder and import it. I'll add as an example my current sketch, so don't expect a lot of documentation for the moment.


Usage
-----

Check the examples folder, my current implementation, which uses Link2fs, an awesome software found here: http://www.jimspage.co.nz/Link2fs_Multi.htm
